# Bookstore Website

## Project Overview
This is a **Bookstore Website** developed as a full-stack web application using **HTML**, **CSS**, **PHP**, **MySQL**, and **JavaScript**.  
The purpose of this project is to demonstrate a complete web solution where users can browse, search, and manage a collection of books in an online store.  
It highlights my skills in front-end design, back-end development, database management, and dynamic user interaction.

## Features
- **Browse Books:** Users can view a catalog of books with detailed information such as title, author, genre, and price.
- **Search Functionality:** Users can search books by different criteria like title, author, or genre to find desired books quickly.
- **Admin Management:** Admin users can add new books, update existing book details, or delete books from the database.
- **Responsive Design:** The website is fully responsive and works smoothly on both desktop and mobile devices.
- **Database Integration:** Uses MySQL for robust and persistent storage of book data.
- **Dynamic Interactions:** PHP handles server-side processing and database communication, while JavaScript enhances client-side interactivity.

## Installation & Setup Instructions

To run this project locally, follow these steps:

1. **Clone the Repository**  
   Download the project files from GitHub:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/inuriiidissanayaka/bookstore_website.git

Set Up a Local Server:
You can use the PHP built-in server for quick setup or tools like XAMPP, MAMP, or WAMP for a more complete environment.

Using PHP built-in server:
Open your terminal or command prompt
Navigate to the project directory

Run the following command:
php -S localhost:8000
Configure the Database
Create a new MySQL database (e.g., bookstore_db)
Import the SQL schema if provided (this will create necessary tables and sample data)
Update database connection settings in the PHP configuration file (e.g., config.php) with your MySQL username, password, and database name.
Access the Website
Open your web browser and go to:
http://localhost:8000

Usage:
As a visitor, browse the collection of books and use the search function to find specific books by title, author, or genre.
As an admin (if authentication is implemented), manage the bookstore by adding new books, updating details of existing books, or deleting books from the catalog.
The site dynamically updates the displayed content based on database information ensuring consistency.
Challenges and Learning Outcomes

Database Integration: 
Learned how to connect PHP with MySQL, perform CRUD operations securely, and handle real data.
Responsive Design: Gained experience in building layouts that adapt to different screen sizes using CSS.
Full-stack Development: Practiced combining front-end and back-end technologies to create a cohesive application.
Problem Solving: Managed challenges such as server configuration, debugging PHP errors, and handling asynchronous JavaScript interactions.

Future Enhancements:
Implement user authentication and role-based access control for better security.
Add advanced filtering and sorting options for the book catalog.
Improve UI with frameworks like Bootstrap or Tailwind CSS.
Introduce payment gateway integration for online purchases.
